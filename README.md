## File Structure

```
pwa/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Main app file with PWA features
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json           # PWA manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ sw.js                   # Service worker for offline functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js                  # Main application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css              # Responsive styles
â”œâ”€â”€ northern_italy_trip_itinerary_revised.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ generate-icons.html     # Icon generator tool
â”œâ”€â”€ icons/                  # App icons directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icon-72x72.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icon-96x96.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (all sizes)
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

## Development

To update the PWA:
1. Make changes to the files
2. Update the cache version in `sw.js` (change `CACHE_NAME`)
3. The app will automatically prompt users to update

## Notes

- The PWA works offline by caching all resources
- Map tiles are cached for offline map viewing
- The service worker handles updates automatically
- iOS requires specific meta tags for proper installation
- The app includes swipe navigation for mobile users

## Troubleshooting

**App won't install:**
- Ensure HTTPS (not required for localhost)
- Check that manifest.json is accessible
- Verify all required icons exist

**Offline mode not working:**
- Check browser dev tools â†’ Application â†’ Service Workers
- Ensure service worker is active
- Check cache storage for cached resources

**Updates not working:**
- Force refresh (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
- Clear cache and reload
- Check service worker updates in dev tools
